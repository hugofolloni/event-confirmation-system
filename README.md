This is a system for event confirmation. It includes the backend APIs for get data and the frontend.

## 🧔 User Story 
As a manager, I can create an event and add it to the system. After that, I can send the link for people and they can get to the list. After this, an e-mail will be sent, and the people can confirm their attendance. At the end, the manager can also set alarms for the event, sending email to the confirmed people.
